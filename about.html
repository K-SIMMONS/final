            <p> Hello! My name is Ken Simmons and I am the proud owner of KA Construction. In the early years of my
                business, we were solely a flooring specialist company. Since then we have grown into a total remodel
                business when I passed and received my general contractors license in 2012. I am a husband and a father
                of 2 boys who are employed within the company. Together with my crew, we have completed over 5,000 jobs
                and
                counting! Thank you for exploring our company, we hope to be a part of your next remodel project! </p>
